                    <h1> Welcome to Caleb's World</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to my page and since you are here, I will tell you about myself and things I love doing. I am 26 and passionate about life. I would like to think of myself as a student of life. Since we utilize a small percentage of our brain capacity, I am curious to explore more. I don't know if its possible or not but all I can do it try. I dont have any prior knowledge on Software Development and thats why I am here, TRYING something NEW. Getting to write this and doing this is an achievement even though I am not perfect yet. I will keep going.</p>
